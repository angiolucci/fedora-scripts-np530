Fedora scripts for Samsung series 5 (NP530U3C)
==============================================

 My personal collection of scripts to configure
Samsung series 5 Ultra for Fedora Linux 
(or was it the other way around?).

How to install:
----------------
Ensure that you have `gcc` installed and run `install.sh` with
root privileges

How to use:
------------
The `install.sh` script should place all files in the proper folder,
so there's no need to aditional configuration.

The only exception are the fn+F11 and fn+F12 keys. 
Just bind them to `performance.sh` and
`rfkill.sh` scripts.
